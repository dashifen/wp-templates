# wp-templates

These are objects which encapsulate behaviors for templating systems for use within WordPress.  They were originally a part of the [wp-handler](https://github.com/dashifen/wp-handler) repo, but I separated them here since what these objects do isn't really about handling WP action and filter hooks like those objects are.
